====================
1 NETWORK TRIVIA
====================

a)  unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). 
For communications within a network segment, it is used as a network address for 
most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth

b)

c)

d)

e) An attack that bombards a victim’s network with more traffic than 
it can handle. Floods a website with fake
DNS lookup requests to consume the bandwidth until the
site eventually crashes.

f) A collection of connected IP routing prefixes

g)

h)  It is used by network devices, including routers, to send 
error messages and operational information indicating success or 
failure when communicating with another IP address

i) The laser may be powerful enough to cause damage to your eyes. 
Also the infrared lasers are invisible to the naked eye,
which allows you to look at them for a long period of time
without even realizing the damage they're causing. While not
all of them are harmful, it's better to be safe than sorry.

j) Symmetric encryption (old technique) uses a single key that needs 
to be shared among the people who need to receive the message. 
Asymmetrical encryption (relatively new technique) uses a pair of 
public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when communicating. 

k) Too much data arriving before a device can handle it causes data overflow, meaning the data is either lost or must be retransmitted.

====================
2 QUEUING THEORY 
====================
a)

b)
i. 
ii. If there are 4 arrivals an hour, the help desk
would require 4 specialists to fully ensure that 
no one would have to queue

iii. That there would only be 4 arrivals per hour

iv. During peak work hours, when most people are using their 
computers or devices

====================
3 INFORMATION THEORY
====================
a) While WiFi offers more convenience than copper wires, 
devices with copper wiring (and wired connections in 
general) will enjoy a significantly more stable connection
than those with a WiFi connection. 
Assuming the speed of the WiFi and the wired connection is 
the same, the copper wire connection would, in most 
scenarios, be able to transfer more data than the WiFi

b)
i. 

ii. 101 Nodes. If each node can recieve 100 messages and each
node can send a message to every single one, then one node
can send a message to the other 100 nodes.



====================
4 TCP/IP
====================
a) 1. A: Send a SYN segment
   2. B: Send a SYN-ACK segment
   3. A: Send an ACK segment
   4. B: Enter the TIME-WAIT segment
   5. A: Send an ACK+DATA segment
   6. B: Send an ACK segment
   7. A, B: Do the rest of the data exchange
   8. A: Send a FIN segment
   9. B: Send a FIN segment
   10. A: Close the connection
   11. B: Close the connection

c) SYN cookies move the state of connection into the ACK field

d) It guarantess reliable and in-order packet delivery.

e) A reciever can send SACK packets to the sender which informs him of the data that was recieved. Then, instead
of retransmitting all of the data segments, the sender
can simply retransmit those that are missing.

f) It's an issue which can occur as a result of badly 
designed or implemented TCP flow control. It's when
a sender transmits data slowly and/or a receiver 
receives data slowly.

====================
5 Networks and Addressing
====================
a) Subnet         IP           Broadcast addr
   44.36.35.0/27
   10.12.13.0/24
   18.0.0.0/8


b) NAT solves IPv4 address exhaustion. There are only so 
many IPv4 addresses available (less than 4.3 billion)
so they're bound to run out eventually. One IP address
of a single NAT gateway can be used by an entire private 
network. Using this method can conserve the available
addresses.

c) TURN, NAT Hole punching, STUN, ICE, UPnP, NAT-PMP (PCP)
   NAT hole punching is one of those methods.
   The basic story of a NAT Hole Punch is that, when both 
   the Nodes who want to connect to each other send a 
   message to the server. Server responds to both nodes with 
   each other’s IP address and Ports (Endpoints). Both Nodes 
   try to establish a connection with each other by sending 
   a message to each other, The messages are discarded by 
   the receiver side NATs but the sender side NATs note down 
   the address to which message is sent and any incoming 
   messages from that address will be considered as a reply 
   to this message an will be routed to the source endpoint. 
   Both Nodes again try connecting to each other by sending 
   a message. But now the messages are received successfully 
   as the NAT thinks that this message is a reply to the 
   previous(failed) message.BOOM! a connection is 
   established and a HOLE IS PUNCHED.

====================
6 Network design and security
====================
a) Its purpose is to add an additional layer of security to 
the clinic's LAN. Most of the clinic's network is safe
behind a firewall and external networks can only access
the part of the clinic's network that's within the DMZ

b) It's best to use two firewalls. One of them can
allow only traffic from external networks to the DMZ while
the other can allow only traffic from the internal network
to the DMZ. Bonus points for having two firewalls from two
different vendors since it's unlikely that the same
security vulnerability can be exploited to get past both of
the firewalls.

c) A phishing attack is described as an attack that can be
executed via social engineering. 

DNS servers use UDP instead of TCP. With UDP, there's
no guarantee that the sender is who they say they are.
This made it easier for the attackers to reroute the 
traffic from the clinic's WWW to their own malicious
site that they could have used to steal the user's 
information (via a fake log in page for example).

Such an attack can be prevented by utilizing DNSSEC
(Domain Name System Security Extensions). DNSSEC
can be used for verifying the data integrity and
the origin of a DNS.

7 Bluetooth
====================
a)
  i. GAP is what makes a bluetooth device visible and
  sets the conditions on how devices can interact with
  or connect to each other.

  iv.
  v. The hackers can exploit flaws in OBEX.
