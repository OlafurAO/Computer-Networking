\vspace{\stretch{1}}
    \part
        An IT help desk is available 8 hours a day, with a single person to 
        provide help. Assume the average
        exponentially distributed service time for each person needing help

\section*{Information Theory}
\question
\begin{parts}
\part[4] Shannon's limit on the communication of information in a single
        channel, places a hard mathematical limit on the amount of information
        that can be communicated over a single channel for a given amount
        of bandwidth, power and noise.  Consider 5 devices that are connected
        via copper wires, versus 5 devices that are connected via WiFi.
        Assume that the bandwidth, power, and noise of the communication medium
        (i.e. copper vs wireless) are identical.

        Is the amount of information that can be transmitted to the end devices
        the same in both scenarios? Explain.

\vspace{\stretch{1}}


\part You are asked to audit a real time networked system, with a full
mesh topology.  Each node in the system can receive and process 100 messages/second
from other nodes in the system. What is the maximum number of nodes the
system can support, when:
    \begin{subparts}
        \subpart[2] On receipt of any message, a node sends a message to at most one other node
        in the mesh.

        \subpart[2] On receipt of any message, a node sends a message to all the other nodes in
        the mesh.

        \subpart[2] Pick one of the two cases above, and explain how it could be
        re-architected to have more nodes than the limit you calculated.

\section*{TCP/IP}
\question
  \begin{parts}
      \part[3] The table below shows the sequence of events that happen during a TCP connections      between two hosts A and B, when A opens a connectiion to B, sends a single data segment, 
      and then closes the connection. Order the events as they
      occur as part of the connection, and indicate which host or hosts they occur at.

     address for that subnet.

    \part[2] What addressing problem does Network Address Translation(NAT) solve
    for IPv4 network addresses?
\vspace{\stretch{2}}

     \part[3] Because NAT violates the end to end principle of the Internet,
     initiating connections to addresses behind NAT routers is problematic.

     and briefly describe how it works.

\section*{Network Design and Security}
\question
You have been asked to consult on the network security of the small health
clinic shown in the diagram below. All computers in the clinic are on the
same Local Area Network(LAN), which uses a small cisco router to connect
to the Internet. The medical record database is stored on a dedicated linux computer
also on the LAN, and is accessed by all the office computers except the payroll
computer. A WiFi Network is used by employees to access the LAN
with their cell phones, and to provide a guest network for patients. The fishtank
is not on any network, but a manufacturer supplied cellphone APP is used to
monitor its temperature by staff.

The clinic also supports a public web server which is used
for patient appointments, to advertise times for Flu shots and other
public announcements.

\begin{parts}
\part[2] What is the purpose of the Demilitarized Zone(DMZ)?
\vspace{\stretch{1}}
\part[2] Is one firewall sufficient? 
\vspace{\stretch{1}}

\part[4] The clinic's WWW address was recently used in a phishing attack,
after attackers altered its public DNS record via a DNS cache poisoning exploit.
Explain what happened, and how the clinic could prevent this from happening again.
\vspace{\stretch{1}}

\part The Blueborne(CVE-2017-1000251) attack, announced in September 2017, allows an
attacker to install and run malicious code on affected bluetooth devices without any interaction
with the user. The attack has been sucessfully demonstrated on all major computer and mobile
phone platforms, and many other bluetooth devices.  The attack can also propagate itself 
to other bluetooth devices.

Assume that none of the Bluetooth devices in the Clinic have been patched.
\begin{subparts}
    \subpart[2] Explain how an attacker on the Guest network could probe for local bluetooth
devices.
\vspace{\stretch{1}}

\subpart[4] Explain all the steps in a plausible attack that uses the office fishtank
to attack the payroll computer and extract data to a visitor's laptop.
\vspace{\stretch{3}}

\end{subparts}

\part[4] Given that the Cisco router provides support for Virtual Lans (VLAN),
draw and label a diagram showing how to reorganise the network to provide better security for
the payroll computer. You may add additional named devices if you wish, and should provide
a brief explanation for the reasons for your changes. 

\end{parts}

\section*{Bluetooth}
\question
\begin{parts}
\part An American company is selling a personalised, Bluetooth 5.0 toothbrush,
which measures heartrate, brushing frequency, and duration of brushing. It uploads
this information to a company server. The
product is marketed specifically towards children, under the age of 12, to help
their parents monitor their brushing habits. The devices use a commodity chip
which supports the full bluetooth stack, and pairs with an Android phone acting
as a master.
\begin{subparts}
\subpart[2] What is the bluetooth Generic Access profile(GAP)?
\vspace{\stretch{1}}
\subpart[2] Explain how two Bluetooth LE devices from different manufacturers
can share information.
\vspace{\stretch{2}}
\subpart[2] How will the toothbrushes pair with a phone?
\vspace{\stretch{1}}

\subpart[4] The company also sells a blue tooth enabled smart lightbulb, which is controlled
with the same software. A household using both products will typically have
over 20 light bulbs and several toothbrushes.

Describe using a labelled diagram, and stating clearly any restrictions on connectivity,
how these bluetooth 5.0 devices can network together.
\vspace{\stretch{2}}
\subpart[4] A large number of dentists have been given these toothbrushes as part of a marketing campaign to
distribute to customers. Unknown to either the dentists or the manufacturer, hackers have
found a way to use the firmware in the toothbrushes to create a botnet for industrial espionage. Describe a
plausible way this could be done, assuming that each household has at least
one mobile phone which has not been updated to fix the Blueborne attacks.
Include an explanation of how the toothbrushes could be identified, and also how
information can be extracted from the toothbrushes back to Hacker HQ.
